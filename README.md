# üõí Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project

This repository contains my end-to-end **Walmart Sales Analysis Project** built entirely in **Power BI**. It simulates a real-world business analyst scenario using sales data to uncover insights, trends, and performance drivers across different time periods and regions.

---

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze Walmart sales performance across time, stores, and regions
- Track and compare KPIs like Total Sales, YTD Sales, and Growth
- Use advanced DAX and time intelligence functions
- Design professional dashboards with clean visuals
- Demonstrate practical skills expected from a Business/Data Analyst

## ‚ùó Business Problem

Walmart, a retail giant, operates hundreds of stores across various regions. However, decision-makers face challenges in quickly understanding:

- Which stores are underperforming or overachieving?
- How do holiday periods affect sales performance?
- What is the overall sales trend across months and years?
- How do different regions contribute to total revenue?

The business needs a **centralized dashboard** that allows management to:

- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Compare current vs previous year sales
- Analyze store-wise, region-wise, and time-based performance
- Make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategy

## üß† Key DAX Measures Used

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM('Walmart_sales_analysis'[Weekly_Sales_Amount])

Sales LY = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Walmart_sales_analysis'[Weekly_Sales_Amount]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Walmart_sales_analysis'[Invoice Date])
)

% of Total Sales = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('Walmart_sales_analysis'[Weekly_Sales_Amount]),
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Walmart_sales_analysis'[Weekly_Sales_Amount]),
        ALL('Walmart_sales_analysis')
    )
)
